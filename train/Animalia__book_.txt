Animalia (book).
"'Animalia"' (ISBN 0810918684) is an illustrated children's book by Graeme Base. It was published in 1986.
"Animalia" is an alliterative alphabet book and contains twenty-six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet. Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for alligator, B is for butterfly, etc.) along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words. The illustrations contain many other objects beginning with that letter that the reader can try to identify. As an additional challenge, the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture. In 1987, "Animalia" won the title of Honour Book in the Children's Book Council of Australia. In 1996, a tenth anniversary edition was released.
Base also published a colouring book version for children to do their own colouring.
A television series was also created, based on the book, which airs in the United States, Australia, Canada, the UK, Norway and Venezuela. It also airs on Minimax for the Czech and Slovak Republics. And recently in Greece on the channel ET1.
Graeme Base also created a series of riddles relating to hidden objects within each of the illustrations written especially for the wall frieze.
In 2010, The Base Factory and AppBooks released Animalia as an application for iPad and iPhone/iPod Touch.
